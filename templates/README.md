## Running your app

In the VS Code _Command Palette_ choose "Open Folder in Container" which will launch your application in a Docker container allowing for realtime development and testing.  Once launched, the application can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000{{appPrefix}}](http://localhost:3000{{appPrefix}}) and tested using the [VS Code Swagger Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arjun.swagger-viewer) (`swagger.json`)

## Deploying to AWS

    $ ./deploy

## AWS requirements

In order to successfully deploy your application you must have [set-up your AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gs-cli.html) and have [created an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) with the following [policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage.html):

- [IAMFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FIAMFullAccess)
- [CloudFrontFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FCloudFrontFullAccess)
- [AWSCloudFormationFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FAWSCloudFormationFullAccess)
- [AWSLambda_FullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FAWSLambda_FullAccess)

WARNING: The policies above are provided to ensure a successful application deployment.  It is recommended that you adjust these policies to meet the security requirements of your Lambda application.  They should NOT be used in a Production environment.

### Mounting the AWS configuration

In order to deploy from within the container using [VS Code terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics) you will need to enable* the following line in: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

```json
"mounts": ["source=${localEnv:HOME}/.aws,target=/root/.aws,type=bind,consistency=cached"],
```

(*) Requires container rebuild.

## Developers

### CLI options

Run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) on project sources:

    $ npm run lint

Generate [Swagger](https://swagger.io) OpenAPI definitions:

    $ npm run genapi

Generate documentation using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app):

    $ npm run gendoc

## Known issues

### Project files are assigned root priviledges

This is due to a [bug](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/2402) in the [Remote Container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension, not this project.  During the container build process when the local machines's UID/GID matches an existing user UID/GID in the container it assigns `root` by default.  Note, in normal circumstances the [`remoteUser`](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/#remoteUser) assigned would be `vscode` which always matches the local machine's user UID/GID values.
